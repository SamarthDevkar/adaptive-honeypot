# Adaptive AI-Driven Honeypot

This project implements an adaptive honeypot that uses AI to detect, classify, and dynamically respond to evolving network threats using tools like Cowrie, Python, and ML models.

## Temporary Project Structure

- `extract_commands.py`: Extracts commands from Cowrie JSON logs
- `train_classifier.py`: Trains TF-IDF + Naive Bayes model
- `classify_live.py`: Classifies real-time attacker commands
- `cowrie/`: Cowrie honeypot setup

## Setup

See documentation inside each script.
